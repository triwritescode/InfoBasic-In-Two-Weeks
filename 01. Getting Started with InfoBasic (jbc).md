## Step 1: WRITE your program

Using any code editor of choice create a file called `HelloProg.b` on your computer and add the following lines of code:

```basic
PROGRAM HelloProg
    CRT "Hello there!"
END
```

Line 1 we have PROGRAM and the name of our program. This should be the name of the file without extension. _In most of cases, we will be writing_ `SUBROUTINE` _instead of_ `PROGRAM`. _Subroutines run inside T24 while programs run on jshell._

## Step 2: PUSH or Copy your code to T24 Server

Push your source code to the server using git `git` or `ftp` (depending on what is available to you. You can also `copy` and `paste` your source code into a file on the server with the same name. Make sure the file is created in your local `.BP` folder (eg. `MATHISI.BP`)

---
## Step 3: COMPILE your source code file

Use `BASIC [FOLDER_NAME] HelloProg.b` program to compile your source code:

```java
jsh t24 ~ -->BASIC MATHISI.BP HelloProg.b
HelloProg.b
BASIC_13.c
Source file HelloProg.b compiled successfully
```

---
## Step 3: CATALOG your program

Any T24 program needs to be catalogued before it can run. Use `CATALOG [FOLDER_NAME] HelloProg.b`:

```java
jsh t24 ~ -->CATALOG MATHISI.BP HelloProg.b
HelloProg
Object HelloProg cataloged successfully
```

---
## Step 4: RUN your program

To run your program, simply type the name of the program `HelloProg` from the `jsh` prompt:

```java
jsh t24 ~ -->HelloProg
Hello there!
```

As you can see, our message **"Hello there!"** was printed on the console.
