## Big Picture

**InfoBasic** (Pick BASIC) is a business-oriented language on MultiValue databases. You work with whole records, which are just strings split by special marks: field (@FM), value (@VM), subvalue (@SM). You read a record by key, slice it with angle brackets like rec<field,value,subvalue>, update it, and write it back. Output goes to the terminal with CRT.

## Learning Order

1. Getting Started with InfoBasic (jbc) 
2. Variables & Data Types
3. Operators
4. Control flow
5. Strings & conversions
6. Subroutines vs functions
7. Select lists → batch process many records.
8. Error handling, hygiene, performance → production readiness.
9. Record IO + locking → real work safely with other users.
